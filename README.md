# COVID-19 Data-Exploration-Project-with-SQL

This project is a data exploration exercise that uses SQL to analyze real-time data of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021. The project aims to explore the data by country and continent to gain insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people around the world, and understanding the spread and impact of the virus is crucial in developing effective policies and interventions. Through this project, I analyze various data points such as the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries to gain insights into the trajectory of the pandemic in different parts of the world.

To achieve this, I used several SQL concepts such as temporary tables, common table expressions (CTEs), and views to organize and analyze the data. My analysis covers various countries and continents, providing a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact worldwide.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to gain experience in SQL programming and data analysis. I hope that the insights gained from this project can contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
